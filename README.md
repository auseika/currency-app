- We had some political issues for the past 26 years, an unfortunately due to internet shutdown after "elections" and protest later I've been able to reach my laptop and finish this task only in the evening aug 10. Still, you can trace development via github, it took 1 day of coding. Thank you in advance for understanding. If you need proofs - I have photos with timetags.
